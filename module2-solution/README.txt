and happily wagged its tail like DOGs always do. JACK and BRYAN wanted very much to see the ELEPHANT. CHILDREN squealed happily. PARENTS were preparing to leave while DOB was running between their legs.
LUCY decided to take the DOG for a walk, but suddenly she realized that BRYAN already did it and DOG was on a walk for some time.
Finally, late afternoon the whole family packed into a car a headed for the ZOO. In the ZOO stood proudly the ELEPHANT.
- Gosh, what a big trunk - shouted CHILDREN. MUM silenced the cheerful squeals of her CHILDREN. DAD, the HEAD of the FAMILY told the story about what the ELEPHANT eats. CHILDREN listened interested.
